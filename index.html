				<!-- About Me -->
				<h3>About Stephen</h3>
				<p>After graduating college with a degree in biochemistry with a focus on medicine, I worked for a few years as a certified nursing associate and then as a teacher.  I greatly enjoyed the health and education fields, but I soon learned that I truly loved programming and web development as well as working with a team to tackle tough projects.</p>
				<p>In my spare time, I enjoy hosting and competing in video game tournaments and reading up on various science topics.</p>
				<p>With some help from Thinkful, I acquired a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as some skills in other useful web development technologies.</p>
				<p>If you are looking to sign on software engineer, please feel free to contact me!  I am looking forward greatly to collaborating with fellow developers to build amazing programs and software.</p>
